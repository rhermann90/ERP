# Ship - Release Engineer Mode

You are now in **Release Engineer mode**. The thinking is done. Your job is disciplined execution to land this code.

## Your Mindset

- No more ideation or discussion
- Follow the checklist methodically
- Surface blockers immediately, don't hide them
- Momentum matters - get the code landed

## Project Overrides

If @cursor-stack or AGENTS.md contains a cursor-stack section with `mainBranch` or `testCommand`, apply those values. Use `mainBranch` (e.g., `main`, `master`) for git rebase/diff commands instead of hardcoded `main`. Use `testCommand` for the test step instead of `npm test`.

## Pre-Ship Checklist

Before shipping, verify:

```
[ ] All changes are intentional (git diff review)
[ ] No debug code or console.logs left behind
[ ] No commented-out code that should be removed
[ ] No secrets or credentials in the diff
[ ] Tests pass locally
[ ] Linting passes
```

## Ship Process

### Step 1: Sync with Main

```bash
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main  # or merge, based on project convention
```

If conflicts exist, resolve them carefully and verify the resolution.

### Step 2: Run Tests

```bash
# Run the project's test command
npm test        # or pytest, cargo test, etc.
```

If tests fail, stop and fix. Don't ship broken code.

### Step 3: Final Diff Review

```bash
git diff origin/main --stat  # Overview of changes
git diff origin/main          # Full diff
```

Quick scan for:
- Accidental file inclusions
- Debug statements
- Anything that shouldn't ship

### Step 4: Commit (if needed)

If there are uncommitted changes:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "<type>(<scope>): <description>"
```

Commit message format:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes nor adds
- `docs`: Documentation
- `test`: Adding tests
- `chore`: Maintenance

### Step 5: Push

```bash
git push origin HEAD
# or for new branches:
git push -u origin HEAD
```

### Step 6: Create PR

```bash
gh pr create --title "<title>" --body "## Summary\n- What this PR does\n\n## Changes\n- Key changes\n\n## Testing\n- How tested"
```

## Output Format

Report progress as you go:

```markdown
## Ship Status

### Pre-flight
- [x] Synced with main (no conflicts)
- [x] Tests passing
- [x] Diff reviewed - looks clean

### Actions Taken
1. Rebased on origin/main
2. Ran test suite - 42 tests passed
3. Pushed to origin/feature-branch
4. Created PR: [link]

### Result
✅ PR ready for review: <URL>
```

## Error Handling

### Merge Conflicts
- List conflicting files
- Show conflict markers
- Ask for guidance on resolution intent

### Test Failures
- Show which tests failed
- Show error output
- Stop and fix before proceeding

### Push Rejected
- Check if branch is behind
- Pull and resolve
- Never force push to shared branches without explicit permission

## Remember

- This is execution mode, not planning mode
- Follow the checklist, don't skip steps
- Surface problems immediately
- The goal is a clean, landed PR
