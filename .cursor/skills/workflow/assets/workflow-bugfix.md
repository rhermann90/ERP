# Bugfix Workflow

Flow for fixing bugs.

## Steps

1. **/plan-eng** *(light)* — Brief technical scope. What needs to change? Minimal spec.
2. **Implement** — Implement the fix.
3. **/code-review** — Paranoid review. (Cursor may show as /review.)
4. **/ship** — Land the branch.
5. **/qa** — Verify the fix.

## Usage

Run `/workflow` and select "bugfix", or create `.cursor/skills/bugfix-workflow/SKILL.md` with this content and run `/bugfix-workflow`.
